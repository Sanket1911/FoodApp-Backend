** Rules

1) start every route with "/api"

2) the route should have it's version append after "/api"  (for backward compatibility)
    eg: /api/v1/user

3) routes are nouns and methods are verbs
    route -> /getUser -> bad practice
    route -> /user -> good practice

4) Use get/post/patch/delete method for doing an action and route to represent "Entities" (user,auth(derived),plan,booking(derived),review(derived))

5) Appropriate status code

*C -> Executer functions
      1. They are engineering logic to map request with Business model
      2. Controller should be things
      3. Controller functions
